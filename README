Installing
==========

For information on installing ease.js on your system, see INSTALL.
Alternatively, you may install the software using npm by issuing the
following command:

  $ npm install easejs



Configuring
===========

If your distribution contains a `configure' file in the project root, you
may jump immediately to INSTALL.

Otherwise, you likely have the sources as they exist in the project
repository, which does not contain the generated `configure' script; you
may generate it by issuing the following command:

  $ autoreconf -fvi

Please note that certain files (such as AUTHORS, NEWS, and ChangeLog) are
generated as part of the `dist' target and do not exist as part of the
repository.



Hacking
