<h3>Savannah</h3>
<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/easejs/">Savannah</a> is the main
development and distribution site for GNU software; it is itself free software.

<h3>Gitlab</h3>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/easejs/easejs">Gitlab</a> is also recommended, as it
is itself free software (Gitlab CE).

<h3>GitHub</h3>
GitHub is a popular social coding platform.  Unfortunately,
it <a href="whyfreejs.html">serves proprietary JavaScript</a> to users, and
is not fully functional with JavaScript disabled.  A mirror of GNU ease.js
is provided there, if you wish to make use of it; a link will not be
provided here, as that would encourage use of an unethical alternative.

<h3>Manual</h3>
See <a href="manual/Integration.html#Integration">Chapter 1 of the manual</a>
for more information on downloading and integrating ease.js into your own
projects.
